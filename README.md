# UX (User Experience)

## Wireframes
The following images show wireframes of each of the 3 pages of the site. These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/).

### Intro Page
This is the landing page that first appears when the user loads the website. Some introductory text appears and also a text box underneath that allows the user to enter a username to continue the game, as a personal touch to keep the user engaged. If this box is left blank the user will be assigned the name "Guest".
